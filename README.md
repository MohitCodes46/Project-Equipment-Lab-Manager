# Project Equipment Lab Manager

## Overview

Equipment Lab Manager is a Java-based application developed using Apache NetBeans IDE. The primary objective of this project is to streamline and manage lab equipment efficiently. The application leverages an Oracle Database for robust data storage and utilizes JDBC for seamless connectivity between the Java application and the database.

## Features

- **Equipment Inventory Management:** Add, update, view, and remove lab equipment details.
- **User Management:** Maintain user records and permissions for accessing equipment.
- **Check-in/Check-out System:** Track the usage and availability of equipment in real-time.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports on equipment usage, availability, and maintenance.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly locate equipment or user records using intuitive search options.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (100%) — Core language for application logic and UI.
- **Apache NetBeans** — Integrated Development Environment for building and managing the project.
- **Oracle Database** — Backend database for data storage.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** — For connecting and executing queries on the Oracle DB.
